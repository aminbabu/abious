## Project Overview

Universalyst is a platform created to empower artists by providing them with a space to showcase their creativity, buy, sell, and advertise their artwork. The platform aims to build a robust community of artists and art enthusiasts, offering an easy-to-navigate environment for browsing, purchasing, and selling art.

## Goals & Objectives

The main goal of Universalyst was to build a seamless platform for artists to market and sell their work while maintaining an intuitive user experience. Key objectives included:

- Building an easy-to-use, responsive front-end & dashboard design.
- Integrating complex APIs to ensure smooth interaction between the platform’s various features, such as user management, art transactions, and advertising.
- Providing artists with the tools they need to upload and manage their artwork, create profiles, and interact with buyers.

## Role & Responsibilities

Initially, I was tasked with designing the frontend of the platform, including the user interface for the homepage, artist profiles, and art galleries. This included the dashboard for managing uploaded art and sales statistics.
However, midway through the project, the team decided to assign me the responsibility of integrating the platform’s APIs as well. This decision was made due to the urgency of the project and my understanding of both design and development, which made me well-suited for this task.

## Process

The project had a very tight timeline, which put immense pressure on me and the team. Initially, I planned to complete the design work first and then begin API integration once the endpoints were available. However, the process turned out to be far more challenging than I anticipated.

The APIs, although ready, were not without their issues. There were numerous flaws in the API responses and endpoint structures. These inconsistencies led to significant delays, as each endpoint required thorough testing and adjustments. I had to collaborate closely with the backend team, meticulously testing each endpoint and working on fixing the flow, data structure, and response errors.

This troubleshooting process was incredibly time-consuming. Each fix would lead to further issues in other areas, and it felt like a never-ending cycle of debugging and testing. The pressure of the tight deadlines and the constant back-and-forth between the front-end and back-end teams added a layer of stress to the project. Despite the challenges, I remained focused on fixing each problem as it arose and ensuring the APIs worked seamlessly with the front-end design.

In the end, the process took longer than I initially expected, but I was able to integrate the APIs fully and align them with the front-end structure.

## Outcome & Results

Alhamdulillah, despite the unexpected hurdles, we successfully completed the project. The client was pleased with the final result, and Universalyst launched as planned. Artists could easily upload their artwork, manage their profiles, and make transactions within the platform. The integration of all the features, from buying and selling to displaying art in galleries, was smooth, and the client’s goals were fully achieved.

The project also provided a positive learning experience for the entire team. While the project had its fair share of challenges, the final outcome was a testament to our collective effort and determination to succeed.

## Tech Stack

- **Laravel** – The core backend framework used for handling authentication, database operations, and API development. Laravel’s robust ecosystem helped streamline backend development and security.
- **WebSockets (Pusher)** – Enabled real-time updates for notifications, live interactions, and instant feedback between users. This improved engagement and responsiveness on the platform.
- **Next.js** – Used for building the frontend with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities. It ensured fast loading times and SEO optimization.
- **Axios** – A powerful HTTP client used for making API requests efficiently with automatic request/response transformations and error handling.
- **SWR** – A React hook for data fetching, caching, and revalidation, ensuring a smooth user experience with minimal API calls.
- **Splide.js** – A lightweight and flexible JavaScript library used for creating responsive, touch-friendly carousels and image sliders.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework that allowed rapid styling and ensured a consistent, modern UI without writing extensive custom CSS.

## Key Learnings

This project taught me invaluable lessons in handling pressure, expectations, and deadlines. Some key takeaways include:

- **Unimaginable Pressure**: The constant pressure to deliver on time pushed me to think on my feet and act quickly when faced with problems.
- **Expectation Management**: I learned to manage my expectations and adapt to unforeseen challenges, as things rarely go as planned.
- **Unbreakable Willpower**: The project demanded persistence and the ability to keep going even when things seemed overwhelming.
- **Teamwork**: This project highlighted the importance of clear communication and collaboration between teams. Working closely with the back-end team to solve API issues was crucial to the project's success.
- **Technical Growth**: Integrating APIs and solving technical problems that arose deepened my understanding of API architecture, error handling, and improving the developer experience.
