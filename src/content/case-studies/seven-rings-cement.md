## Project Overview

Seven Rings Cement is a well-established cement manufacturer looking to modernize their online presence. The objective was to build a responsive, user-friendly website that effectively showcased their products and services while maintaining a professional, visually appealing design suitable for the industry.

## Goals & Objectives

The main goal of this project was to create a modern, responsive website that would highlight the company's brand and offerings effectively. The objectives included:

- **Professional Design**: Use modern design elements and animations while maintaining a professional and trustworthy look.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Ensure smooth navigation, easy access to information, and interactive features like carousels and animations.
- **Collaboration with Back-End**: While I did not directly work on WordPress, I collaborated with the back-end team to integrate dynamic content with MySQL.

## Role & Responsibilities

I was responsible for the **front-end development** of the website, where I took charge of crafting the visual design, interactivity, and overall responsiveness. Key responsibilities included:

- **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript Development**: Building the front-end structure using **HTML**, **SCSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic features.
- **SplideJS Integration**: Integrated **SplideJS** for a responsive, interactive image carousel to showcase products effectively.
- **AOS Animation**: Added **AOS Animation** for smooth scrolling animations, enhancing the user experience and making the website more engaging.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilized **Webpack** to bundle and optimize assets, ensuring fast load times and improved performance.
- **Collaboration with Back-End Team**: Worked closely with the back-end team to ensure the seamless integration of **WordPress** and **MySQL**, facilitating easy content management and dynamic data integration.

## Process

### Tight Deadlines and Project Rush

Originally, the project was estimated to be completed within **14 days**. However, the timeline was shortened, and I was required to deliver the front-end in just **6 days**. Despite being unwell, I pushed through and focused on delivering high-quality results within the compressed timeline.

### Development Approach

1. **HTML and SCSS Development**: I structured the website using **HTML** and created a responsive layout with **SCSS**, ensuring the design was optimized for all devices.
2. **Carousels and Animations**: Integrated **SplideJS** for a touch-friendly image slider and used **AOS Animation** for dynamic scroll-based effects.
3. **Optimized Performance**: Used **Webpack** to bundle and minify JavaScript and CSS files, improving load times and overall performance.
4. **Collaboration**: Although the back-end team handled **WordPress** integration, I worked with them to ensure that dynamic content was properly pulled and displayed using **MySQL**.

## Outcome & Results

Despite the challenges and health issues during the project, I successfully completed the front-end in just 6 days. The website now provides a responsive, professional look, showcasing Seven Rings Cement's products and services effectively. The client was pleased with the design and the interactive elements, which added to the overall user experience.
